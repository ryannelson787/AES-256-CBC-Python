This is a self-created implementation of the AES-256-CBC algorithm, created in Python. The AES_256_CBC class handles encryption and decryption, from both PyCrypto's implementation and my own.

Note: this implementation is not rigorously tested. I suggest using tried and true implementations of AES-256 for any sensitive data.
